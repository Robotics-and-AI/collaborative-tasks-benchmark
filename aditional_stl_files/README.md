## Additional 3D printable supports

In addition to the essential and optional hardware, three supports are made available to aid the assembly process.
These supports were used to guarantee a repeatable setup in the accompanying article while performing the proposed manufacturing assembly scenarios 

All supports can be fixed to a T-slot aluminium extrusion frame, with the use of screws and T-nuts.
